Feature: Flashing phase transition

Define:
T - flashing interval;

[*]
Scenario: Initialization of LM resets flashing phase off;
Given: The system clock is zero;
When: Called init;
Then: Flashing phase is off.

[*]
Scenario: Flashing phase is off when the system clock is less than T/2;
Given: System clock is less than T/2;
When: Called update;
Then: Flashing phase is off.

[*]
Scenario: Flashing phase is on when the system clock is greater than or equal to T/2 but less than T;
Given: System clock is greater than or equal to T/2 but less than T;
When: Called update;
Then: Flashing phase is on.

[*]
Scenario: Flashing phase is off when the system clock is greater than or equal to N * T but less than (N + 1/2) * T;
Given: System clock is greater than or equal to N * T but less than (N + 1/2) * T;
When: Called update;
Then: Flashing phase is off.

[*]
Scenario: Flashing phase is on when the system clock is greater than or equal to (N + 1/2) * T but less than (N + 1) * T;
Given: System clock is greater than or equal to (N + 1/2) * T but less than (N + 1) * T;
When: Called update;
Then: Flashing phase is on.

[*]
Scenario: Initialization of LM resets flashing phase off regardless of the current system time.
Given: System clock is C != 0;
When: Called init;
Then: Flashing phase is off.

[ ]
Scenario: Flashing phase (off) is calculated relative to the time of initialization;
Given: System clock is greater than or equal to C + N * T but less than C + (N + 1/2) * T;
When: Called update;
Then: Flashing phase is off.

[ ]
Scenario: Flashing phase (on) is calculated relative to the time of initialization;
Given: System clock is greater than or equal to C + (N + 1/2) * T but less than C + (N + 1) * T;
When: Called update;
Then: Flashing phase is on.
