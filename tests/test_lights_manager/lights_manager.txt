Description:
============
The Lights Manager (LM) controls 32 two-state lights.
The LM can program an individual light to turn On, Off or Flashing.
The flashing functionality is software enabled, provided the special update
procedure should be called periodically.

Requirements:
=============
- Programming an individual light should not immediately change it's state.
- The update procedure should aggregate all the changes and apply the new state
of all the lights in a single driver call.
- All the lights programmed in Flashing mode are being turned on and off
simultaneously even though they programmed at the different times.
- The update procedure is responsible to calculate the current phase of the
flashing and apply it to all the lights programmed in Flashing mode.
- The frequency of calling the update procedure should be at least twice more
often as the flashing interval.
- In case the light was off and is programmed to Flashing and the current
flashig phase is on, the light should not be turned on until the next phase
to avoid possible flicking. Similarly, if the light was on and is programmed
to Flashing and the current flashing phase is off then the light should not
be turned off until the next phase.
- The initialization of LM should program and turn off all the lights.
- The LM uses shreg_driver to manipulate lights state.

Test cases:

Non-flashing functionality:
---------------------------
[*]: Initialization of LM turns all the lights off;
[*]: Calling update if no lights programmed does't cause changing state;
[*]: Programming light On does't cause changing state;
[ ]: Can turn on one light;
[ ]: Can turn on multiple lights;
[ ]: Programming light Off does't cause changing state;
[ ]: Can turn off one light;
[ ]: Can turn off multiple lights;
